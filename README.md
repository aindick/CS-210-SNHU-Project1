--Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Chada Tech Clock was a program that can tell the user the time depending on which clock they go by whether it's the 12 hour clock or 24 hour. The clock is solving the problem of being inclusive when it comes to clock viewing. Some customers go by the 24 hour while others go by the 12 hour. 

--What did you do particularly well?

I think making the interface for the clock I did very well in. It is easy to use and easy to read for users.

--Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could inprove the issue where I got a security warning every time I tried using local time. I tried looking for better solutions online but I think it comes down to just the security of the computer. I'll have to see if there's a better way to not have to disable it through code since it can be quite dangerous to ignore the warning. Using threads would probably be a cool improvement too.

--Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The biggest challenge I had was figuring out how to get the clock to tick on its own. I did a lot of trial and error with it and figured out that using a while loop and the sleep function would help. I definitely will be using the sleep function more often since it is important when using threads later on. 

--What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The use of functions and loops was important here and will be important for other projects. Having separate functions made it easy to read the code and understand what was going on. Loops helped with keeping the program running until the exit function was executed.

--How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I kept it maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of functions. Separate functions kept the code clean and easy to manage along with read. If I were to use classes, it would do the same thing for the code too but I felt functions were easier to deal with for the time being.
